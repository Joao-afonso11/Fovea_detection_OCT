# Fovea_detection_OCT

# Project Title
Automated outer retinal bands segmentation in healthy subjects by deep convolutional neural networks

## Overview
This Github highlits the code for the detection of the central fovea for B-Scans from a SD-OCT machine.
Allows for centered and non-centered images to have the exact location of the center fovea.
